        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Lasagna is a classic Italian dish made with layers of pasta, sauce, cheese, and often meat or vegetables. To cook lasagna, start by preparing the key ingredients: a meat or veggie sauce (like a tomato-based ragu), a creamy béchamel or ricotta mixture, lasagna noodles (either pre-cooked or oven-ready), and shredded cheese like mozzarella and Parmesan.
            To assemble, spread a thin layer of sauce at the bottom of a baking dish. Add a layer of noodles, followed by sauce, cheese, and any other fillings. Repeat these layers until the dish is full, finishing with a layer of sauce and cheese on top.
            Cover the lasagna with foil and bake in a preheated oven at 375°F (190°C) for about 40–45 minutes. Remove the foil for the last 10–15 minutes to allow the top to brown and bubble. Let it rest for 10–15 minutes before slicing and serving.
